avalanche establishes the foundation for a package based CSS workflow. Heavy weight CSS toolkits often stay in your way when creating unique looking experiences or they lead to a rather bland design. But you don't have to reinvent the wheel for every new project either. avalanche provides building blocks for you to handpick and integrate into your workflow.

## Get started
avalanche comes with a CLI to kickstart new projects:

```bash
# Install the avalanche CLI.
npm install @avalanche/cli -g
# Create a new project with the name "Your Project Name".
avalanche "Your Project Name"
```

avalanche is flexible in the way you can use it â€“ it is also very easy to integrate avalanche packages into your existing project. [Learn more about how to use avalanche](https://avalanche.oberlehner.net/get-started/).
